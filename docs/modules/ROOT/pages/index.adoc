= Neo4j ETL

== Overview

include::README.adoc[lines=6..-1,leveloffset=+1]

== Introduction

The Neo4j ETL, especially the `neo4j-etl` command-line tool, can be used to import well modeled (i.e. normalized) relational data into Neo4j.
It applies some simple rules for transforming the relational model.

The process as outlined below:

. Read database metadata and generate mapping.json
. Optionally edit mapping.json with the `neo4j-etl-ui` in Neo4j Desktop
. Export relational data to CSV
. Generate Mapping Headers
. Import into Neo4j using
.. the `neo4j-import` tool for initial *offline* bulk load
.. the `neo4j-shell` tool for incremental *offline* bulk load
.. the `cypher-shell` tool for incremental *online* single-transaction load
.. the `java bolt driver` for incremental *online* batch load

=== What it is

* Command-Line tools 
* Java API/library
* Infer Schema and save in mapping file
* Filter and merge strategies
// * Describe indexes
// * Non-trivial datatypes (dates, binary)
* Read mapping file to export data from other databases then
* Import into Neo via different tools (`neo4j-import`, `neo4j-shell`, `cypher-shell`, `java bolt driver`)
* Work in offline and online mode
* Import in both an empty (initial load) and not-empty graph (incremental)
* Build indexes and constraints
// * Non-trivial datatypes (dates, binary)
* Support on Unix-like and Microsoft Operating Systems
* Support for most popular relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and Microsoft SQL
* Support user specified JDBC drivers
* UI tool to visually modify mappings

=== Plans for the Future

* Custom Mapping Rules + Transformations for names, data, links
* Exemplary integration into a 3rd party ETL pipeline
* More data types (binary, datetime, geo)

=== Who is it for

* Developer learning to work with Neo4j for initial data import
* Partners providing data integration with Neo4j
* Enterprise developers building applications based on well modeled relational data

=== Open Questions

* Date and binary datatypes
* Security (secure connections, handling of passwords, encrypting data)

== Capabilities

=== Inferring Schema with Mapping Rules (generate-metadata-mapping)

* Generic relational database mapping based on the following rules
* A _table_ with a foreign key is treated as a _Join_ and imported as a _node_ with a _relationship_
* Ex: `+Person -> Address+` is imported as `+(Person)-[:ADDRESS_ID]->(Address)+`
* A _table_ that has two foreign keys is imported as a _JoinTable_ and imported as a _relationship_
* Ex: `+Student <- Student_Course -> Course+` is imported as  +
`+(Student) -[:STUDENT_COURSE]-> (Course)+`
* A _table_ that has more than two foreign keys is treated as an _intermediate node_ and imported as _node with multiple relationships_
* Ex: `+Order_Detail -> Shipping_Address, Order_Detail -> Payment_Information, Order_Detail -> Shipment_Instructions+` is imported as

----
(Shipping_Address) -[:SHIPPING]-> (Order_Detail)
(Payment_Information) -[:PAYMENT]-> (Order_Detail)
(Shipment_Instructions) -[:SHIPMENT]-> (Order_Detail)
----


* Resolve relationships through composite keys.
* Support most of the data types.
** _TinyInt_ can be imported as either _Byte_ or as a _Boolean_ _(This is to support boolean values being saved in mysql as TinyInt)_
** _Dates_ are imported as _String_
** _Blobs_ are skipped while importing until the import-tool supports binary array data.
** _Decimal to be confirmed._

* Relationship names can either take _column name_ or the _table that is being referred to_
** `--relationship-name=table` then a `+Person->Address+` will become `+(Person)-[:ADDRESS]->(Address)+`
** `--relationship-name=column` will become `+(Person)-[:ADDRESS_ID]->(Address)+`

* Filter tables that you want to include or exclude using `--include` and `--exclude`

* TODO: Filter columns that you want to include or exclude using `--include` and `--exclude`

* TODO: Retaining natural keys(marked as PrimaryKeys and ForeignKeys) as needed using <TBA> flag
** A Foreign Key is usually used to create a relationship between 2 nodes without being saved as a property. 
** With this flag, the node would keep that value as a property. 
** Ex: A loan has the SSN of the loan applicant which would normally be used to connect the `Loan` and `Person` nodes. 
** With this flag the `Loan` node will also keep the `SSN` as a property.

=== Edit Mapping via UI

A Neo4j-ETL graph application can be added Neo4j Desktop which allows visual editing of the mapping and interactive import.

The UI allows you to change and set you preferred *label* names, *property* names and types, *relationship* types, with a preview of the resulting graph.

=== Exporting Data (export)

* Generate CSV files from relational source as outlined by `mappings.json` 
** TODO: Use a streaming api that is more performant
* Import CSV providing the correct labels and rel-types and headers headers
** TODO: Missing ability to pass options to `neo4j-import` tool as a file instead of command line arguments
** TODO: Create indexes and constraints related to not-primary key columns
